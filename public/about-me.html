      <p>
        Hi, I am Benjamin Jaume, I am a 24 year-old Frenchman living in Sydney
        for almost 2 years. In early 2018, I was eager to discover the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        was curious about being imersed in a new country, a new culture, a new
        way to think, new landscape, and also new language!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am taking courses, attempting events, connecting with people and
        much more to start my career in the field that has always been made for
        me! On my spare time, I like to go for hikes, eat some sushis, travel
        somewhere or even go for a long run. Self-consciousness,
        self-development food and sport
      </p>

              The project came to an end so I had to find something else to do.
              This is why I thought that I could start discovering what is
              around in Europe. I travelled to UK with a friend of mine and to
              Netherlands with my brother.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of all these travels, I took the decision travel to
              Australia so I had to save up a bit of money and be prepared for
              the biggest trip of my life!

              At the end of my studies, the company I did my apprenticeship with
              hired me at a casual worker. I was responsible for the deployment
              of the ticketing machines (maintaining the MS Excel Macro), and
              uploading their software. I also gave a hand to the electricians
              installing the equipments in the vehicles. Because it was also
              interesting for me, I decided to continue in the fiels of
              electrical installation and work night-shifts.

              I continued my studies with an apprenticeship. This year was all
              about applying the knowledge I've accumulated in the past few
              years at school but also at work. Even with a high level of math &
              physic, we had a lot to learn: industrial programming,
              cryptography, security, database, network, hardware, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company was specialised in optic fibre, installing landline
              and embed equipment. I was working on the big project of replacing
              ticketing machines in Traways & Bus. I've provided a solution for
              a better management of the deployment by developing a 800-lines MS
              Excel Macro.

              Beginning of my studies at Uni. It is getting more technical and
              computer science orientaded. I spent more thant hald of my weeks
              in the lab with 4 different teacher all specialised in different
              field in I.T. One was teaching Networks/Windows, one teaching
              Linux/Database/C programming, one teaching C/C++/OOP programming,
              one teaching Electronic/Data.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where I've learn the most things in I.T and this is where
              I had the best time studying. We had to create a lot of different
              application and project assessed thouhought the 2 years.

              I started a 2-years program in Computer Science, where I leart the
              fundamentals of electronic, math, physic and programming. I also
              had the chance to discover how technologies and sustainable
              development work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The teachers (which I was getting along well) had a big knowledge
              with, and I was confortable with computer science so I created
              with a friend a few projects (check my
              <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>). The main projects we had
              were based on C/C++ micro-controllers, Arduino and Labview.

              It all started when I was 15: my father gave me his Casio Graph
              35+ Calculator. I started programming for my friends and I to
              solve mathematical problem and create games. I I discovered that I
              was passionate about algorithmic, problem solving and programming.
