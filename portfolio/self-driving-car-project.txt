This all started in 2010. It was at the time when I was learning
      programming at school with an Arduino board. I imagined at the time that
      the possibilities of things to do where infinite ! And it was time for me
      to experiment something. My best friend, Axel was studying micro-component
      and electronic at a deeper level than me and he had already a good
      knowledge of how electronic component work. So we both agreed on starting
      a project together, and thought about the Self Driving Car! After days and
      days of welding, thinking, drinking beers and programming in a small
      garage, we actually made it! Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures /
      program left to this day
