This project has been created by my friend Axel and I. He is a big fan of
      Daft Punk, and he'd found a coffee table made by them. We thought that it
      was possible to do it with a bit of wood, two speakers, some LEDs and an
      Arduino. So we did it. Because it was at the time when we were
      experiencing our new skills, the table didn't look really good, so we
      threw it away a few days after finishing it.
