          Hi, I am Benjamin Jaume, I am a 24 year-old Frenchman living in Sydney
          for almost 2 years. In early 2018, I was eager to discover the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          was curious about being imersed in a new country, a new culture, a new
          way to think, new landscape, and also new language!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I am taking courses, attempting events, connecting with people and
          much more to start my career in the field that has always been made
          for me! On my spare time, I like to go for hikes, eat some sushis,
          travel somewhere or even go for a long run. Self-consciousness,
          self-development food and sport
        </p>

                The project came to an end so I had to find something else to
                do. This is why I thought that I could start discovering what is
                around in Europe. I travelled to UK with a friend of mine and to
                Netherlands with my brother.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of all these travels, I took the decision travel to
                Australia so I had to save up a bit of money and be prepared for
                the biggest trip of my life!

                At the end of my studies, the company I did my apprenticeship
                with hired me at a casual worker. I was responsible for the
                deployment of the ticketing machines (maintaining the MS Excel
                Macro), and uploading their software. I also gave a hand to the
                electricians installing the equipments in the vehicles. Because
                it was also interesting for me, I decided to continue in the
                fiels of electrical installation and work night-shifts.

                I continued my studies with an apprenticeship. This year was all
                about applying the knowledge I've accumulated in the past few
                years at school but also at work. Even with a high level of math
                & physic, we had a lot to learn: industrial programming,
                cryptography, security, database, network, hardware, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company was specialised in optic fibre, installing landline
                and embed equipment. I was working on the big project of
                replacing ticketing machines in Traways & Bus. I've provided a
                solution for a better management of the deployment by developing
                a 800-lines MS Excel Macro.

                Beginning of my studies at Uni. It is getting more technical and
                computer science orientaded. I spent more thant hald of my weeks
                in the lab with 4 different teacher all specialised in different
                field in I.T. One was teaching Networks/Windows, one teaching
                Linux/Database/C programming, one teaching C/C++/OOP

                This is where I've learn the most things in I.T and this is
                where I had the best time studying. We had to create a lot of
                different application and project assessed thouhought the 2
                years.

                I started a 2-years program in Computer Science, where I leart
                the fundamentals of electronic, math, physic and programming. I
                also had the chance to discover how technologies and sustainable
                development work.

                The teachers (which I was getting along well) had a big
                knowledge with, and I was confortable with computer science so I
                created with a friend a few projects (check my

                had were based on C/C++ micro-controllers, Arduino and Labview.

                It all started when I was 15: my father gave me his Casio Graph
                35+ Calculator. I started programming for my friends and I to
                solve mathematical problem and create games. I I discovered that
                I was passionate about algorithmic, problem solving and
                programming.
